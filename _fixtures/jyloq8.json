      "comment": "<p>How do you figure?  SMS 2FA is still technically &ldquo;two factors&rdquo;, in that you have to verify you are in possession of the account password and of the phone you have registered.  However, I think the author is confusing 2FA with Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;backup&rdquo; authentication mechanism.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>How did this happen? I had two-factor authentication turned on for Google (remember how I said I would occasionally get auth code texts that I hadn&rsquo;t requested?).</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I think those auth code texts are what Google sends when you do &ldquo;Forgot my Password&rdquo; and you have a phone number stored with them.  In reality, this backup authentication mechanism is better than the stupid security questions since it&rsquo;s harder to compromise, although after reading this story, I&rsquo;d probably recommend no phone number on file and just enter randomly generated passwords as security question answers that you also store in your password manager.  This way there is no &ldquo;easy&rdquo; reset mechanism at all.</p>\n",
